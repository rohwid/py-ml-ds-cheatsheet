    "# What is Autoencoder?\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoder is **a neural network model that has the same input and output**. The autoencoder studies the input data and attempts to reconstruct the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then what's the use of Autoencoder? Autoencoder is used to **reduce the dimensions of features (Dimensionality Reduction)**. If the data form by very high dimension (data with a very large number of features). For example, it can be each feature spread over each dimension of the data, so that each of the existing data looks very different. To overcome these problems require very much data or reduce the dimensions of the data. PCA can be use here, t-SNE, or Autoencoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/decoder.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoder consists of two main parts, **encoder** and **decoder**. Between the encoder and decoder, there is a **code layer**. The number of neurons in the code layer is **the number of dimensions that expect to reduce the dimensions of our data**."
